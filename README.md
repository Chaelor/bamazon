This is my first time working with MySQL and node together!<br>
This app is a CLI based app that takes in arguments via the command line. Then, it will make calls to the database and post information requested by the user. <br>

If the user uses the customer.js, they will have options to view and buy(provided said item is in stock).<br>
The customer.js will automatically display all of the items in the database. If the user wishes to purchase an item, they will do so by selecting the id of the item, and if the item is in stock and has enough quantity, they will be able to purchase the item(s).<br>

If the user uses the manager.js, they will be able to add new items, update quantities, view low stock items, and view all products available for sale.
